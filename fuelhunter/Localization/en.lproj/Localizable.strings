So you could save up to ~ 4 eur per month in this way. \n\nYou get it for Eur 48 a year - It's already one free full lighthouse! \n\n(Note that this is the best case. Maybe you already live in one of the cheapest stations on the way. Then no savings will come because you are already cheap refilled, but you will come to the realization that you were one of the cheaper ones!).\n\nAt least you can feel better knowing that there is no point in hunting for the cheapest fuel, unless it is any “meaningful savings“!";
