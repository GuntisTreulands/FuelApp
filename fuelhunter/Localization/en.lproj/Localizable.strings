There the price is always about 5 cents more expensive than the cheapest one. Instead, if I refueled at the cheapest station in Riga and had at least 40 liters of free light, the savings would be ~ 2 eur! \n\nThere are sometimes up to 2 lighthouses a month when commuting to work (15km / day) or off-campus. So you could save up to ~ 4 eur per month in this way. \n\nYou get it for Eur 48 a year - It's already one free full lighthouse! \n\n(Note that this is the best case. Maybe you already live in one of the cheapest stations on the way. Then no savings will come because you are already cheap refilled, but you will come to the realization that you were one of the cheaper ones!).\n\nAt least you can feel better knowing that there is no point in hunting for the cheapest fuel, unless it is any “meaningful savings“!";
